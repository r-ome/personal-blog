# Documenting on how I deployed my blog

## Why?

I've been a software engineer for years, and I've been reading blogs here and there and I really think I've already waited too long for build my own.

And since I'm getting out now with my personal hiatus, I think it's a nice small project I can work on.

I've been thinking and checking technologies that I'll use but I've decided on using Astro as a static generator and deploying it with AWS S3 and Cloudfront. No overwhelming technologies.

So, first of all, I need to list down all of the things that I would do.

1. Check Astro Documentation and on how to start a project with it. Check the features available and leverage on it.
2. Since I choose to use static sites, I'll just use AWS S3 for serving static pages.
3. Buy a domain `jeromeagapay.com`. (I'm not really good at choosing catchy names so I just settled with my name).
4. Connect the domain with Cloudfront.
5. Find a minimalist design. (I'm not really good at creating designs)
6. Code the website.
7. Deploy and add github actions for automating syncing aws s3 with build files.
8. Test and experiment things.

## Checking out Astro

As I'm looking for lightweight static site generator. I've stumbled upon [Astro](https://astro.build/). I've read a lot of good feedbacks about it and wanted to try it. I've considered using NextJS but since I've already created a freelance project with it and wanted to try new something new, I've settled with Astro.
